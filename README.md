Welcome to our Product Delivery App Project!

This is a mobile application designed to deliver products from markets within your local area. We will be developing the frontend using Flutter and building the backend with Node.js / Express (TypeScript + MongoDB).

To help you understand the system, a simple use case diagram will be provided. From there, we’ll iterate on the functionality based on requirements and feedback. The goal is to build a polished and functional app that will serve as a strong portfolio piece for all of us.

Please make sure to only commit files related to this project. No more sending documents through Telegram—keep everything within the repository.

If you encounter issues related to Git or GitHub, try to resolve them on your own first. This is a great opportunity to level up your skills and get a feel for real-world development.

Welcome to the world of professional software development, where merge conflicts and bugs can sometimes feel like nightmares 🐞😅—just kidding (sort of)! Let’s make this an awesome journey together.

P.S. This README will be updated once the project is complete.
